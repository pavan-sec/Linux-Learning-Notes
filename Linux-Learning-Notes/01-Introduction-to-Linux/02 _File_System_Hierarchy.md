# Linux File System Hierarchy (FHS)

The Linux operating system organizes all its files and directories in a **tree-like hierarchy**, starting from the root directory (`/`). This structure is standardized by the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)](http://www.pathname.com/fhs/), ensuring consistency across different Linux distributions. Understanding the FHS is fundamental for navigating and managing files efficiently in Linux.

| Path          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`           | The **root directory**. This is the top-level directory and contains all other directories and files on the system. It's essential for booting the OS and acts as the mount point for other filesystems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `/bin`        | (Binary) Contains **essential command binaries** available to all users (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `/boot`       | Consists of the static files of the **boot loader**, kernel executable, and files required to boot the Linux OS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `/dev`        | (Devices) Contains **device files** that represent hardware devices (e.g., `/dev/sda1` for a hard drive partition, `/dev/null` for discarding output).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `/home`       | Contains **user home directories**. Each non-root user typically has a subdirectory here (e.g., `/home/username/`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `/lib`        | (Libraries) Stores **shared library files** required by the essential programs in `/bin` and `/sbin` during system boot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `/media`      | Mount point for **external removable media devices** such as USB drives, CD-ROMs, etc., when they are automatically mounted by the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `/tmp`        | (Temporary) A directory for **temporary files** created by the operating system and various programs. Its contents are generally cleared upon system boot and can be deleted at other times without warning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `/usr`        | (Unix System Resources) A major directory containing **user programs and data** that are not essential for system booting. It includes executables (`/usr/bin`), libraries (`/usr/lib`), documentation (`/usr/share/doc`), and local binaries (`/usr/local/bin`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `/var`        | (Variable) Contains **variable data files** that change frequently during system operation. This includes log files (`/var/log`), email inboxes (`/var/mail`), web server files (`/var/www`), and temporary files that are persistent across reboots (`/var/tmp`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### User Context & Shell Prompts

* The **home directory** for the currently logged-in user is often represented by a **tilde `~`**. When you log in, this is your default working directory.
    * Example: `cd ~` will take you to your home directory (e.g., `/home/yourusername`).
* The **dollar sign `$`** at the end of a command prompt indicates that you are currently operating as a **regular (unprivileged) user**.
    * Example Prompt: `username@hostname:~$`
* The **hash symbol `#`** at the end of a command prompt indicates that you are logged in or operating as the **`root` user** (privileged user). The `root` user has full system access.
    * Example Prompt: `root@hostname:~#`

### Important Notes

* **Absolute vs. Relative Paths:**
    * **Absolute paths** start from the root directory (`/`), e.g., `/home/user/documents`.
    * **Relative paths** are relative to your current working directory, e.g., `documents/` if you are in `/home/user`.
* **Symbolic Links (Symlinks):** Many directories within the FHS might be symbolic links (shortcuts) to other locations, especially for compatibility reasons (e.g., `/bin` often points to `/usr/bin`).
