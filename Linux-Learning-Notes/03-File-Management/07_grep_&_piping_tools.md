# Grep & Piping Tools

The `grep` command and the concept of "piping" (`|`) are incredibly powerful and commonly used tools in Linux for text processing and command output manipulation.

### `grep` - Global Regular Expression Print

`grep` is a command-line utility for searching **plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression pattern**. It's used to filter text and is extremely versatile for finding specific information within files or output streams.

Typically, `PATTERNS` should be quoted when `grep` is used in a shell command, especially if they contain spaces or special characters, to prevent the shell from misinterpreting them.

#### Method 1: Search Inside a File

This method uses `grep` to search for a pattern directly within one or more specified files.

* **Syntax:** `grep "pattern" filename`
* **Simple Terms:** "Use `grep` to find this specific `pattern` within this `filename`."
* **Example:** Find lines containing "dynamic" in `/etc/passwd`.
    ```bash
    grep "dynamic" /etc/passwd
    ```
    * **Output Example:**
        ```
        sshd:x:107:65534::/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin
        systemd-coredump:x:999:999:systemd Core Dumper:/:/usr/sbin/nologin
        ```
        (If "dynamic" matches any part of these lines)

#### Method 2: Use with Pipe (`|`) to Filter Command Output

Piping allows you to take the output of one command and use it as the input for another command. This is where `grep` truly shines for real-time filtering.

* **Syntax:** `command | grep "pattern"`
* **Simple Terms:** "Run a `command`, and then take its output and filter it using `grep` to show only lines matching `pattern`."
* The `command` can be anything that produces output to standard output, like `cat`, `ls`, `ps`, `ip a`, `journalctl`, etc.
* **Example:** Find lines containing "apache" in the `/etc/passwd` file's content.
    ```bash
    cat /etc/passwd | grep "apache"
    ```
    * **Output Example:**
        ```
        apache:x:108:114:Apache2 web server:/var/www:/usr/sbin/nologin
        ```

* **More Practical Example:** Find currently running processes related to "firefox".
    ```bash
    ps aux | grep "firefox"
    ```
    * **Explanation:** `ps aux` lists all running processes, and `grep "firefox"` then filters that long list to show only lines containing "firefox".

### Common `grep` Options

`grep` has many options to refine your searches. Here are some of the most frequently used ones:

1.  **`-i` (Ignore Case)**
    * **Purpose:** Makes the search **case-insensitive**, ignoring the difference between uppercase and lowercase letters.
    * **Example:** Find "root" (or "Root", "ROOT", etc.) in `file.txt`.
        ```bash
        grep -i "root" file.txt
        ```

2.  **`-r` or `-R` (Recursive Search)**
    * **Purpose:** Searches for the pattern not just in a single file, but **recursively in all files inside a specified directory**, including its subdirectories.
    * **Example:** Find "password" in all files within `/myfolder/` and its subfolders.
        ```bash
        grep -r "password" /myfolder/
        ```

3.  **`-n` (Show Line Numbers)**
    * **Purpose:** Displays the **line number** along with the matching line in the file.
    * **Example:** Find "error" in `logfile.txt` and show line numbers.
        ```bash
        grep -n "error" logfile.txt
        ```
        * **Output Example:**
            ```
            123: ERROR: Connection refused.
            456: An unexpected error occurred.
            ```

4.  **`-v` (Invert Match)**
    * **Purpose:** Shows all lines that **DO NOT** match the specified pattern. Useful for excluding certain entries.
    * **Example:** Display all lines in `access.log` that do NOT contain "robots.txt".
        ```bash
        grep -v "robots.txt" access.log
        ```

5.  **`-c` (Count Matches)**
    * **Purpose:** Instead of showing the matching lines, it shows a **count** of how many lines matched the pattern.
    * **Example:** Count how many times "failed login" appears in `auth.log`.
        ```bash
        grep -c "failed login" /var/log/auth.log
        ```

6.  **`-l` (List Filenames Only)**
    * **Purpose:** Only prints the **names of files** that contain at least one match, without showing the matching lines themselves.
    * **Example:** Find which files in the current directory contain the word "TODO".
        ```bash
        grep -l "TODO" *.txt
        ```

7.  **`-w` (Whole Word Match)**
    * **Purpose:** Matches only when the pattern forms a **whole word**.
    * **Example:** Search for "user" as a whole word, not as part of "username".
        ```bash
        grep -w "user" users.txt
        ```

8.  **`-A <num>`, `-B <num>`, `-C <num>` (Context Lines)**
    * **Purpose:** Shows lines **A**fter, **B**efore, or **C**ontext (both after and before) the matching line.
    * **Example:** Show matching line and 2 lines after it.
        ```bash
        grep -A 2 "error" application.log
        ```
    * **Example:** Show matching line and 3 lines before it.
        ```bash
        grep -B 3 "connection refused" syslog
        ```
    * **Example:** Show matching line and 2 lines of context around it.
        ```bash
        grep -C 2 "important_event" debug.log
        ```

### The Power of Piping (`|`)

The pipe operator (`|`) is one of the most powerful features of the Linux command line. It allows you to chain commands together, directing the standard output (stdout) of one command to become the standard input (stdin) of the next. This creates powerful, flexible command sequences for data processing.

**General Idea:**
`Command_A_Output` &rarr; `Command_B_Input`

**Example:** Count the number of active users logged in.
```bash
who | wc -l
**Explanation:**
    - `who` lists currently logged-in users (one per line).
    - The `|` takes that list and feeds it as input to `wc -l`.
    - `wc -l` counts the number of lines it receives.
    - Result: The total number of logged-in users.

**Another Example:** List all processes and filter for processes run by user "john".

Bash

`ps aux | grep "john"`

- **Explanation:** `ps aux` lists all running processes, and then `grep "john"` filters that list to show only processes related to user "john".
