# A Beginner's Guide to File Archiving & Compression in Linux

In Linux, you'll frequently need to bundle multiple files into a single file or make large files smaller for storage or transfer. This involves two different concepts: **archiving** and **compression**.

- **Archiving :** This is the process of combining multiple files and directories into a single file, called an **archive**. The most common command for this is `tar`. An archive itself is not any smaller than the sum of the original files.
- **Compression:** This is the process of taking a single file and shrinking its size using an algorithm. Common tools for this are `gzip` and `bzip2`.

Often, you will do both: first, you archive many files into one, and then you compress that single archive file. The `tar` command is powerful enough to do both steps at once.

## `tar` - The Archiving Utility

`tar` (short for **t**ape **ar**chive) is the go-to command for creating and managing archives. It has many options, but you only need to remember a few key ones. The options are often combined without needing dashes.

### Most Common `tar` Options

| Option | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-c` | **c**reate | Creates a new archive file. |
| `-x` | e**x**tract | Extracts files from an existing archive. |
| `-t` | lis**t** | Lists the contents of an archive without extracting it. |
| `-f` | **f**ile | Tells `tar` the name of the archive file to work on. This option should almost always be the last one. |
| `-v` | **v**erbose | Shows the files being processed, one by one. It's useful for seeing the progress. |

### Working with Basic `.tar` Archives (Archiving Only)

**1. Create a `.tar` archive**

This command bundles the `directory1` and `file1.txt` into a new archive named `my_archive.tar`.

```bash
# Command: tar -cvf <archive-name.tar> <file-or-directory-to-archive>
tar -cvf my_archive.tar directory1 file1.txt
```

**2. List the contents of a `.tar` archive**

This command will show you every file inside `my_archive.tar` without extracting them.

Bash

`# Command: tar -tvf <archive-name.tar>
tar -tvf my_archive.tar`

**3. Extract a `.tar` archive**

This command will extract the contents of `my_archive.tar` into your current directory.

Bash

`# Command: tar -xvf <archive-name.tar>
tar -xvf my_archive.tar`

## Standalone Compression Tools

Before seeing how `tar` handles compression automatically, it's useful to know what the compression tools are.

### `gzip`

- **What it is:** `gzip` is the most common and fastest compression utility.
- **What it does:** It compresses a **single file** and adds a `.gz` extension to it, deleting the original.
- **To decompress:** Use the `gunzip` command.

Bash

`# This will create 'important_document.txt.gz' and remove the original file
gzip important_document.txt

##### This will restore the original file and remove the .gz file
gunzip important_document.txt.gz`

### `bzip2`

- **What it is:** `bzip2` is another popular compression utility.
- **What it does:** It generally provides **better compression** than `gzip` (smaller files), but it's a bit slower. It creates a `.bz2` file.
- **To decompress:** Use the `bunzip2` command.

## Putting It All Together: `tar` with Compression

The real power of `tar` comes from its ability to call compression tools internally. This lets you archive and compress in a single, easy command. You just need to add one more option.

- `z` for g**z**ip compression (`.tar.gz` or `.tgz`)
- `j` for b**j**ip2 compression (`.tar.bz2`)

The `.tar.gz` format is the most widely used on the internet.

### Creating and Extracting `.tar.gz` Files (Most Common)

**1. Create a compressed `tar.gz` archive**

We add the `-z` flag to the create command. `c`reate + `z`ip + `v`erbose + `f`ile.

Bash

`# Command: tar -czvf <archive-name.tar.gz> <files-to-archive>
tar -czvf my_archive.tar.gz directory1 file1.txt`

**2. List the contents of a `tar.gz` archive**

The list command is the same, just add the `-z` flag.

Bash

`# Command: tar -tzvf <archive-name.tar.gz>
tar -tzvf my_archive.tar.gz`

**3. Extract a compressed `tar.gz` archive**

Add the `-z` flag to the extract command. e**x**tract + `z`ip + `v`erbose + `f`ile.

Bash

`# Command: tar -xzvf <archive-name.tar.gz>
tar -xzvf my_archive.tar.gz`

### Quick Reference

| Action | Command |
| --- | --- |
| **Create** a `.tar.gz` archive | `tar -czvf archive.tar.gz directory/` |
| **Extract** a `.tar.gz` archive | `tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz` |
| **List** contents of a `.tar.gz` archive | `tar -tzvf archive.tar.gz` |

You can simply substitute the `-z` with `-j` if you ever need to work with a `.tar.bz2` file.
